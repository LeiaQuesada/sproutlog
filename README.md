# SproutLog

A full-stack MVP built with React and FastAPI that help plant owners track tasks over time. The app focuses on clean data modeling, time-based logic, and a clear separation of concerns between frontend and backend.

## Separation of Concerns

- SQLAlchemy models handle persistence

### User Stories:

1. As a user, I can add then view plants with basic details,so that I can keep track of all the plants I am resonsible for.
2. As a user, I want to create care tasks for a plant with a due date, so that I know what care actions are needed and when.
3. As a user, I want to see which tasks are upcoming or overdue, so that I can prioritize my plant care effectively.
4. As a user, I want to mark tasks as completed, so that I can track what care I've already done.

### Tech Stack

- Frontend: React, TypeScript
- Backend: FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Pydantic
- Database: PostgreSQL

### Wireframes:

## Visuals

<!-- Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method. -->

## Installation

<!-- Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection. -->

## Usage

<!-- Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README. -->

## Support

<!-- Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc. -->

## Roadmap

Future considerations.

## Contributing

Open to contributions.

# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is currently not compatible with SWC. See [this issue](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/issues/428) for tracking the progress.

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type-aware lint rules:

```js
export default defineConfig([
	globalIgnores(["dist"]),
	{
		files: ["**/*.{ts,tsx}"],
		extends: [
			// Other configs...

			// Remove tseslint.configs.recommended and replace with this
			tseslint.configs.recommendedTypeChecked,
			// Alternatively, use this for stricter rules
			tseslint.configs.strictTypeChecked,
			// Optionally, add this for stylistic rules
			tseslint.configs.stylisticTypeChecked,

			// Other configs...
		],
		languageOptions: {
			parserOptions: {
				project: ["./tsconfig.node.json", "./tsconfig.app.json"],
				tsconfigRootDir: import.meta.dirname,
			},
			// other options...
		},
	},
]);
```

You can also install [eslint-plugin-react-x](https://github.com/Rel1cx/eslint-react/tree/main/packages/plugins/eslint-plugin-react-x) and [eslint-plugin-react-dom](https://github.com/Rel1cx/eslint-react/tree/main/packages/plugins/eslint-plugin-react-dom) for React-specific lint rules:

```js
// eslint.config.js
import reactX from "eslint-plugin-react-x";
import reactDom from "eslint-plugin-react-dom";

export default defineConfig([
	globalIgnores(["dist"]),
	{
		files: ["**/*.{ts,tsx}"],
		extends: [
			// Other configs...
			// Enable lint rules for React
			reactX.configs["recommended-typescript"],
			// Enable lint rules for React DOM
			reactDom.configs.recommended,
		],
		languageOptions: {
			parserOptions: {
				project: ["./tsconfig.node.json", "./tsconfig.app.json"],
				tsconfigRootDir: import.meta.dirname,
			},
			// other options...
		},
	},
]);
```
